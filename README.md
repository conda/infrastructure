# Conda GitHub Org Infrastructure

This is a centralized location for infrastructure codes and any related inquiries or discussions.

> **Note**
> This is not a forum for end-user questions.

## 👋 Welcome!

We are using [GitHub discussions in this repo](https://github.com/conda/infra/discussions) as a place for [Conda core and community members](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance#teams--roles) to raise issues about the Conda community infrastructure such as:
  * 📦 Package hosting (e.g. conda-forge channel on anaconda.org)
  * 👤 Conda GitHub Org admin questions and issues
  * 🔄 Shared GitHub Workflows synced to other repos in Conda GitHub Org
  * 🧪 Test suite and development setup issues
  * ❔ Anything that does not fall into any other project-specific buckets (e.g. the [conda issues](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues) or [conda-build issues](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues))

Feel also free to:
  * 💭 Share ideas about new features and changes you'd like to see
  * 🗣️ Engage with other community members

Please start by creating a discussion and checking the [Anaconda Status Page](https://anaconda.statuspage.io) for known issues before you open an issue directly.

Welcome others and be open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together 💪.

## GitHub Workflows

We have defined a number of GitHub Workflows that are synced out to other repos within the Conda GitHub Org. These workflows accomplish:
  * 🤖 Automation used for project boards
  * 🏷️ Label standardization
  * 🔒 Marking issues & PRs as stale, closing stale items, and locking inactive items
  * 🔄 Dispersing workflow changes to other repos

## Community License Agreement

📝 We store the config file for the GitHub Workflow in the `.clabot` file, which helps us keep track of the [conda community license agreement](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/contributing.html#conda-contributor-license-agreement) in the various
repos of the conda GitHub organization.
